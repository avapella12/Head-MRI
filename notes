An Algorithm for the Evaluation of Brain Masses from Head MRI Images

Summary: This project builds a Python-based program which processes head MRI scans with the objective of detecting the presence and malignant potentials of any masses. These goals are accomplished using NumPy, a Python library which is capable of conducting mathematical operations and multidimensional arrays, as well as OpenCV, which enables image analysis of jpg files. This student-friendly program will be capable of outputting a number of metrics. First, it will indicate the presence of a mass. Second, it will detect whether the mass is a cyst or a tumor based on a pre-set threshold of signal intensity; cysts appear brighter in T-2 weighted images due to their high water content. Third, the program will determine whether the mass is likely a glioma, meningioma, or pituitary tumor based on its localization. Finally, this program will measure an approximation of the massâ€™ size based on the 2D MRI scans. 

Background: Tumors of the Central Nervous System run the gamut from benign to deadly, and canon medical literature has established distinct imaging characteristics for a number of brain tumors. Though biopsies are necessary for a surefire diagnosis, there is much information to be extracted from MRI scans, which may temporarily inform the patient and suggest further clinical action. Benign, non-metastasized tumors are marked by a clearly defined border, while malignant tumors present with irregular margins. Localization can also be a hallmark indicator of tumor origin. Gliomas arise from glial cells, meningiomas arise from the meninges (brain membrane) with a dural tail, and pituitary tumors are small and sequestered within the pituitary gland. Due to these traits, a visually-guided program would be a valuable diagnostic tool for brain masses.
